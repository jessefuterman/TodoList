I decided to see if I could make a Todo-List in React within 24 hours to challenge myself. It was based around the idea of a 90s geo city website for Music Fans. In this project, you can add users, subtract users and also add the users to a myriad of lists. When these groups no longer have users in them, they will delete themselves. Giving myself the 24-hour window was a very worthwhile and beneficial challenge. 

Front End: React, Javascript, Css
